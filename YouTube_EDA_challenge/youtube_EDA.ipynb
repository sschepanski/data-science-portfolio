    "\n",
    "The data as well as the data-descriptions are retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). The data was collected from Google's You Tube API using an open-source tool available on [Github](https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper)\n",
    "There you can find the following description of this data:  \n",
    "\"YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangnam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "*What does trending mean?*  \n",
    "According to [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en), trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn’t personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.  \n",
    "The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are available for different countries as separate files, in this notebook we will use the daily statistics for Germany for the years 2017/2018.\n"

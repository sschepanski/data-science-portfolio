# Tasks

Please prepare two presentations for the following tasks. The first presentation in German (approximately 10 minutes) should present your solution as you would like to convey it. The second presentation (approximately 5 minutes) should focus on your solution (only tasks 2-3) and be presented to the management of a fictional client. This presentation should be in English.

All the necessary files can be found in the attachment. For the presentation, a Windows PC with a USB port and installed Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader will be provided.

## Task 1 - "Data Preparation"
In the file daten_kunden.csv, you will find a table with sales figures for several customers (of the fictional 'BFCC AG' corporation). The data must be prepared as follows:
- All customers with the suffix "DEK" must be removed.
- The remaining customer values must be aggregated on a monthly basis, so that there is only one total value per month, which consists of the sum of all remaining customer values.

Please find a reproducible solution that can be applied without further effort to a new dataset with the same structure.

## Task 2 - "Past Values for the Future"
The prepared monthly figures from Task 1 now contain the relevant total sales figures. Illustrate the data. Predict the next 6 months and present your results graphically.

## Task 3 - "Changes in the Environment"
In the file afo.csv, you will receive monthly values of the fictional 'afo Business Climate Index'.

The client considers this index important for their field of business. Would you change your forecast from Task 2 based on this knowledge?
